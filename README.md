**A smart chili plant disease detection and targeted pesticide spraying system using YOLOv8 and a mini robotic sprayer to reduce chemical usage and improve crop health.**

---

## Overview
This project automates the identification and control of **Leaf Curl disease** in chili plants using a YOLOv8 object detection system and a spraying mechanism. A top-view image is processed to detect infected leaves, and the sprayer applies pesticide only to the affected regions, reducing chemical waste and improving efficiency in small-scale crop fields.

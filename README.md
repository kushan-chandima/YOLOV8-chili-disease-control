**A smart chili plant disease detection and targeted pesticide spraying system using YOLOv8 and a mini robotic sprayer to reduce chemical usage and improve crop health.**

---

## Overview
This project automates the identification and control of **Leaf Curl disease** in chili plants using a YOLOv8 object detection system and a spraying mechanism. A top-view image is processed to detect infected leaves, and the sprayer applies pesticide only to the affected regions, reducing chemical waste and improving efficiency in small-scale crop fields.

## Software and Tools
- Python
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- Roboflow (dataset preparation)
- Arduino IDE (microcontroller programming)

## Dataset and Model
- Custom dataset: **440 field images**
- Model: **YOLOv8** (trained for Leaf Curl detection)

### ðŸ§  YOLOv8 Model Development
1. **Dataset Creation:** Captured real-world chili leaf images from field conditions.  
2. **Annotation:** Used Roboflow to label diseased and healthy leaves.  
3. **Model Training:** YOLOv8 model trained on the custom dataset for detecting leaf curl disease.  
4. **Testing:** Evaluated performance on unseen images with high detection accuracy.  
5. **Integration:** Deployed model output to control ESP32-based spraying unit.
